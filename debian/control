Description: a seminumeric modelling tool to efficiently simulate the cosmological 21-cm signal
 We introduce a powerful seminumeric modelling tool, 21cmfast, designed to
 efficiently simulate the cosmological 21-cm signal. Our code generates 3D
 realizations of evolved density, ionization, peculiar velocity and spin
 temperature fields, which it then combines to compute the 21-cm brightness
 temperature. Although the physical processes are treated with approximate
 methods, we compare our results to a state-of-the-art large-scale hydrodynamic
 simulation, and find good agreement on scales pertinent to the upcoming
 observations. The power spectra from 21cmfast agree with those
 generated from the numerical simulation to within 10s of per cent, down to the
 Nyquist frequency. We show results from a 1-Gpc simulation which tracks the
 cosmic 21-cm signal down from z= 250, highlighting the various interesting
 epochs. Depending on the desired resolution, 21cmfast can compute a redshift
 realization on a single processor in just a few minutes. Our code is fast,
 efficient, customizable and publicly available, making it a useful tool for
 21-cm parameter studies.
